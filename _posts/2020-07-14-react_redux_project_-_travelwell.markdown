React/Redux Project 

The idea of this project was to create something that would be useful for travel planning. Each time I travel, I find that I have to go to many sources for the right information to find travel vaccination information and then to find activities for that area. I want somewhere where I can take notes on a place I want to travel to for both preparation for health-related things as well as for choosing some of the attractions I am interested in going to. I also want to utilize an API for travel images that would make the app look appealing. 

For this project, I decided to have redux handle all state, including forms. I chose this partly to have more experience handling state and using redux, since keeping local state for the forms felt simple and intuitive for me. 

I started this project still feeling a little shaky about using redux, and now I find myself feeling fairly comfortable navigating it. I have learned a lot, and am proud of this one.

I found 3 APIs to make use of. I used TuGo for travel advisories, Unsplash for images, and am in the process of adding OpenTripMap for travel attractions. 

I also chose to use some CSS styling from scratch, and React Bootstrap for displaying nicer controlled forms, and for displaying travel images in both a jumbotron and in cards. 

In this project I became more comfortable with using React Router to show restful urls for users.
