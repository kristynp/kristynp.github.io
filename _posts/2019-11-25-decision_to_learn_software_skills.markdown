I'm a research scientist. I've worked with engineers in neuroscience and histology to create lab automation tools that lead to massive datasets. It has become increasingly clear to me that the next steps forward in science requre training technology that can handle and sift through massive quantities of data, tools to analyze them quickly and efficiently, and methods to clearly and easily communicate results to those who need it. 

I have worked with scientific software tools created by scientists whose primary skills are not and should not have been in developing good software. The field is crippled by barely functioning tools. I am drawn to the problem solving involved in creating tools to help in any of these areas, but desire to first build knowledge that will enable me to do it well. I'm excited to apply my systematic, scientific approach to the challenges of the software development world. 

But first I'll have to humbly stumble my way into a firehose of new information, and I don't anticipate a quick journey to mastery.
