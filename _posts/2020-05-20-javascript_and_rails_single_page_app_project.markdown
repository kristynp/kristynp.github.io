The idea for this project came from a group of my friends trying to find a good way to record how many countries in Europe we could correctly identify, knowing that we all had gaps in our geography knowledge. So, I created a quiz that would do this, using a numbered map and form inputs for each of the countries. 

This was the largest javascript project I have created, and by the time I got to refactoring for object oriented javascript with different classes, I realized that object orientation would have solved most of the particularly tricky problems that I was having earlier in the project build. I would definitely start with that in mind for the creation of my next javascript frontend. 

This project was excellent for solidifying my understanding of creating an API backend that a frontend can communicate with through fetches. I have a deeper understanding of the process and of the importance of using `.then` to be sure that a promise has resolved before trying to get access to that data. 

I decided not to use bootstrap for this project because I wanted to build some simple CSS styling from scratch to have more practice with it, which I think was valuable. I'm pleased enough with its appearance.
