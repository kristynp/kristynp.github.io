      For this project, I wanted to aim for something that felt genuinely useful in the real world, while still fulfilling the requirements of the project. I recently was among a small team writing a second phase grant proposal for development of automation tools for histology. This proposal was fairly complex and sprawling, and as with all grant proposals, required meticulous research for every assertion, goal to justify the project, and plan for how to accomplish what we proposed. The research papers could be divided into these goals, and while one person would focus on one area or another, there was overlap between team members that required resource sharing. At the time, I recognized that it would be exceedingly useful to have a place where resources used could be categorized, and notes shared on both the research goals and resources that were used, and know where to get access to each one. This lead to my project.
			While I recognize areas that my project falls short of where I ultimately would want it to land, especially in not storing the articles directly, and instead depending on links leading to the article within the journals that contain them, I feel proud of what I have created in a fairly short time, and feel that it is genuinely a useful tool. It allows users to create research goals, and keep visible notes that could be modified or added to by team members, to add resources through the goals and view associated resources, to write notes directly on those resources, to add journals that contain those articles, so that the location is clear. I used scope methods to arrange both journals and research goals by the number of resources belonging to them. For journals, this would allow users to see which journals are the most important for a project, and might help prioritize where to get subscriptions on those that are not open source. 
      This was the first time I used bootstrapping on any project. I've heard of people using it in the past but had only a vague idea of how it might be used. It's still more a functional app than a beautiful app, but I am happy with my initial bootstrapping experience, and have added a tool to my repertoir that feels useful. It certainly helped my forms and navigation bar to look better.
			This was also the first project where I used branches in git to play around with things that might break my code before considering merging them, so I am pleased to have added familiarity with a tool that is fairly ubiquitous.
			Aside from that, I continue to be grateful for a wealth of good resources, for the simple enjoyment that coding brings me, and for continuing to feel progress in learning.
