I have finished my final portfolio project and have scheduled my final assessment. 

I am overall overwhelmingly satisfied with my Flatiron experience. Before starting this curriculum, I had studied some coding, but was having a hard time feeling like I knew enough to know where best to direct my efforts. I had pored over available resources, was doing daily coding challenges, and spent hours and hours reading about coding, but knew I was still completely unable to begin making an app of my own effectively. 

This curriculum was not easy. It was long. There were times when I was frustrated and had to walk away and grab a cup of tea or sleep it off before I could come back to a problem. But Flatiron coaches were readily available when I had stared at a problem too long, and I learned a lot from their problem solving approaches, and sometimes simply by having another set of eyes to catch that missing semicolon. 

I have learned so much. I feel confident now that if I have an idea, I can create it. I have enough tools to get started, and know where to look when I get stuck. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but I now feel like I have a solid set of tools to get started.
